    "# **Sonic Vault** Audio Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was automatically collected using a Python script that records short audio clips from streaming radio stations. The recordings capture live audio from selected stations, with each clip having a random duration between 30 and 90 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Sonic_Vault/ ├── metadata.csv # CSV file logging metadata of each recording ├── NPR<timestamp>1.mp3 # Example audio file from NPR ├── Classic_FM<timestamp>2.mp3 # Example audio file from Classic FM \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio Files**:  \n",
    "  Each audio file is saved in MP3 format. The filename contains the station name, a timestamp, and an incremental index (e.g., `NPR20250309_1430121.mp3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **metadata.csv**:  \n",
    "  This file logs the following information for each recording:\n",
    "  - **Station Name**: Name of the radio station.\n",
    "  - **Filename**: The name of the recorded audio file.\n",
    "  - **Timestamp**: The date and time the recording was made.\n",
    "  - **Duration (s)**: The duration (in seconds) of the recorded clip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Recordings**: 30 audio files.\n",
    "- **Recording Duration**: Each recording has a duration randomly chosen between 30 and 90 seconds.\n",
    "- **Storage Format**: All audio files are stored in MP3 format within the `Sonic_Vault` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Station Selection**:  \n",
    "   The script records from two primary radio stations:\n",
    "   - **NPR**: `http://npr-ice.streamguys1.com/live.mp3`\n",
    "   - **Classic_FM**: `http://media-ice.musicradio.com/ClassicFMMP3`  \n",
    "   *(Additional stations are provided as comments for reference.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recording Mechanism**:  \n",
    "   - The script uses the `ffmpeg` command-line tool to capture audio streams.\n",
    "   - For each clip, a random duration between 30 and 90 seconds is calculated.\n",
    "   - Audio clips are recorded and saved with unique filenames in the `Sonic_Vault` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metadata Logging**:  \n",
    "   - After each successful recording, metadata (station name, filename, timestamp, and duration) is logged into `metadata.csv`.\n",
    "   - The process continues until 30 audio files have been recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling and Timing**:  \n",
    "   - Errors during the recording process are caught and printed without halting the overall process.\n",
    "   - A short pause (2 seconds) is added between recordings to ensure smooth operation."
