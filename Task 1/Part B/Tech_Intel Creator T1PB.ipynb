    "## Overview\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of categorized text data obtained from various online sources. The data is organized into multiple categories related to technology, finance, science, and other domains. The dataset is structured into folders, each corresponding to a category, containing extracted text from relevant articles and blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "The dataset was created using a Python web scraper that utilizes the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The scraper fetched and extracted textual data from multiple websites listed under predefined categories. The extraction focused on article titles and content paragraphs from various HTML structures such as `<article>`, `<div>`, and `<section>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "- **Base Directory:** `tech_intel`\n",
    "- **Category Folders:** Each category has a separate folder named after it (e.g., `technology_news_trends`, `machine_learning_data_science`).\n",
    "- **Data Files:** Inside each category folder, a `data.txt` file contains extracted articles related to that category.\n"
